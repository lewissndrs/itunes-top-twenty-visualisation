A simple single page application to display the current iTunes top 20 singles. Each single is given a full screen to show info about the artist, track and label as well as to display the cover art. To see the next single, or to go back, the user scrolls left or right. Sticky positioning is used to style each single as a "card" rather than a continuous scroll.

This project was built using React and the iTunes API.
